<h1> CREATING A NEW WEB PAGE </h1>
<p>Value means importance or the participation. The value of anyunit in this existence is its participation in the larger order of which itis a part. E.g. value of a pen is that it can write.
The value of a human being is the participation ofhuman being in this order. Hence to understand the human values, weneed to understand the human reality along with all that is there in that
existence constituting the larger order, and the role of human being inthe relationship with each and every unit in the existence.Character oriented education that instils basicvalues and ethnic values in one’s psyche are called ‘Value BasedEducation’. The subject that enables us to understand ‘what isvaluable’ for human happiness is called value education.Self exploration is the process to find out what isvaluable to me by investigating within myself, what is right for me,true for me, has to be judged within myself. Through self explorationwe get the value of ourself. We live with different entirety (family,friends, air, soil, water, trees, etc.) and we want to understand ourrelationship with all these. For this we need to start observing inside

<h2> SURROGATE KEY </h1>
<p>A surrogate key is a special key which has no meaning or purpose other than to uniquely identify each record.Surrogate key is generated when a new record is inserted into a table automatically by a database that can be declared as the primary key of that table .We can say that , in case we do not have a natural primary key in a table, then we need to artificially create one in order to uniquely identify a row in the table , this key is called the surrogate key or synthetic primary key of the table.However , surrogate key is not always the primary key . Suppose we have multiple objects in a database that are connected to the surrogate key, then we will have many-toone association between the primary keys and the surrogate key and surrogate key cannot be used as the primary key.</p>

<h2> NORMALIZATION </h1>
<p>Normalization is the process of structuring and handling the relationship between data to minimize redundancy in the relational table and avoid the unnecessary anomalies properties 
from the database like insertion, update and delete. It helps to divide large database tables into smaller tables and make a relationship between them.First Normal Form (1NF)The table will be in First Normal Form (1NF) if all the attributes of the table contain only atomic values. We can also say that if a table holds the multivalued data items in attribuorcompositevaluesthe relation cannot be in the first normal form. So, we need to make it first normal form by making the entries of the table atomic.Sample Employee table, it displays employees are working 
with multiple departments.</p>
